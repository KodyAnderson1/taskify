# Taskify

This project was created as a tutorial follow along to familiarize myself with Typescript. 

URL: [Taskify](https://taskify-a2209.web.app/)

## Concept / Project Overview
Leveraging Typescript and React, this application tracks user-defined tasks (todos) in two separate areas, an "Active Tasks" area and a "Completed Tasks" area, with a drag-and-drop approach for the user to utilize between the two areas. In addition, users can edit an already created task, delete it, and mark it as completed. See future development below for potential features to be added.

## Languages and Libraries
- Typescript (Javascript)
- React
- CSS
- HTML
- Firebase (Hosting)

## Installation Instructions
To install on your local machine, pull the GitHub repo, navigate into the project's root directory, type `npm install` and then `npm start` in your console, and a localhost version of the app should open in your default browser. To see an active application instance, see the URL at the top.

## Future Development
- Data persistence. (Currently resets on reload)
- Integrate this application into my grade tracker app to provide the start of a student focused "one stop shop" app to track grades, manage to-do lists, etc...
